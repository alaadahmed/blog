      <h2>About me</h2>
      <p>
        I'm an argentinian Optician with lots of interest in software
        development and the Elixir programming language in particular. I'm self
        taught, have good adaptability, and I'm always keen to learn more about
        technology, functional programming and computer science.
      </p>
      <p>
        I volunteer as a moderator of the
        <a href="https://discord.gg/elixir">Elixir Discord server</a>, where we
        provide assistance to other members of the Elixir community, and I'm the
        author of the
        <a href="https://github.com/doorgan/sourceror">Sourceror</a> library for
        AST-based Elixir source code manipulation.

              Sourceror is a toolkit to work with the Elixir source code, the
              first library in the Elixir ecosystem that empowers Elixirists and
              tool authors to build refactoring tools and migration scripts,
              similar to what jscodeshift has to offer for the JavaScript world.

              Embers was an exploratory project to build a social network
              platform with Elixir and the Phoenix framework. It used Phoenix
              Channels for a private chat and real time events, and Presence for
              an asymmetric list of online friends.

              <p>
                I have been using the Elixir language since 2018. I have a solid
                understanding of it's sequential features like project
                structure, protocols, behaviours, releases and standard library.
                I have a strong understanding of the AST representation of the
                Elixir code and how to use it to build macros and tools, and I
                understand the fundamentals of the OTP like GenServers,
                supervision trees and single node concurrency.
              </p>
              <p>
                I also have experience using the Phoenix framework to create
                multiple page applications with realtime features, and with Ecto
                to build both queries and custom validations.

            <dt>JavaScript</dt>
            <dd>
              I have been using JavaScript for 5+ years for personal projects. I
              have good understanding of ES6+ features, Promises, and event loop
              macro/micro tasks. I have experience with Parcel and Snowpack
              build tools, Vue 2 and Svelte frameworks, React hooks inspired
              libraries, and state management patterns like Meiosis, which I
              used to build my personal library

            <dt>PostgreSQL</dt>
            <dd>
              I've been using PostgreSQL since 2018, when I migrated away from
              MySQL. I have experience setting up indexes to speed up queries,
              on setting up constraints at the database level instead of relying
              on application level validations, and I have basic knowledge of
              <code>EXPLAIN</code> queries to find inefficiencies in query
              plans.

            <dt>Docker</dt>
            <dd>
              I have basic understanding of Docker, which I used to build Elixir
              releases, and also to set up development environments with
              docker-compose.
            </dd>

            <dt>PHP</dt>
            <dd>
              I used PHP for my web projects until I discovered Elixir in 2018.
              The previous version of the Embers project was built using the
              Laravel framework v5.6.

            <dt>Other web technologies</dt>
            <dd>
              I have experience working with modern CSS features like flexbox,
              grid and custom properties, pre-processors like SASS and post-css
              as well as responsive designs with media queries. I also have
              experience writing semantic HTML, and I prefer to use progressive
              enhancement techniques whenever possible.
